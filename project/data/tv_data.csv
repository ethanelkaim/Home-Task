1,LG OLED C1 55-inch TV,LG,55,4K,OLED,120,Yes,webOS,"5999,6100,5899","Electro World,Best TV,Mega Store",Tel Aviv,Jerusalem,Haifa,"The picture quality is amazing, especially the deep blacks. It's perfect for watching movies. The sound is decent, but a soundbar is a good idea. The stand is a bit wobbly. The gaming features are excellent for my PlayStation 5. The interface is intuitive and fast. I'm very happy with my purchase. The contrast is unbelievable."
2,Samsung Neo QLED 65-inch TV,Samsung,65,4K,QLED,120,Yes,Tizen,"7200,7350,7150","Mega Store,Tech Pro,Big Deals",Tel Aviv,Haifa,Jerusalem,"The colors are incredibly vibrant, it's very bright even in a sunny room. I was surprised by how thin the screen is. The remote is very simple and easy to use. The sound quality is great. I noticed some light bleed in the corners, which is annoying. The interface can be a bit slow sometimes. The viewing angles are not the best."
3,Sony Bravia 55-inch LED TV,Sony,55,4K,LED,60,Yes,Google TV,"3999,4100","Electro World,Mega Store",Tel Aviv,Jerusalem,"Solid TV for the price. The picture quality is good enough for casual viewing. The speakers are average, but you can't expect much. The Google TV interface is very easy to navigate. It's great for the kids' room. The remote is a bit clunky. It gets very hot after a few hours of use."
4,Hisense U8G 75-inch ULED TV,Hisense,75,4K,ULED,120,Yes,Android TV,"6400,6500","Tech Pro,Best TV",Haifa,Tel Aviv,"This TV is huge! Perfect for a large living room. The picture quality is surprisingly good for the price. The Android TV OS is a bit buggy and sometimes crashes. I had to factory reset it once. The brightness is very impressive. The colors are accurate. It's heavy and requires two people to set up."
5,LG 43-inch 4K LED TV,LG,43,4K,LED,60,Yes,webOS,"1999,2100","Electro World,Big Deals",Jerusalem,Tel Aviv,"Good TV for a small space, like a bedroom or kitchen. The picture is clear. It’s cheap. The sound is terrible, you absolutely need external speakers. The stand is flimsy. It was a great deal during the last sale. It's a very basic smart TV, but it does the job. Easy to set up."
6,Sony Bravia 65-inch 8K OLED TV,Sony,65,8K,OLED,120,Yes,Google TV,"15000,15200","Tech Pro,Mega Store",Haifa,Tel Aviv,"Unbelievable picture quality. The 8K resolution is a bit of an overkill right now but it's future-proof. The sound is phenomenal, no need for a soundbar. It's very expensive. The Google TV interface is smooth. It's a premium product with a price to match. The design is sleek and minimalist."
7,Samsung 50-inch Crystal UHD TV,Samsung,50,4K,LED,60,Yes,Tizen,"2500,2550","Best TV,Electro World",Tel Aviv,Haifa,"It's a solid, no-frills TV. Good for everyday use. Nothing spectacular, but reliable. The colors seem a little washed out. The stand is quite stable. The menus are easy to navigate. The remote is a little small. It’s a good value for the price. The picture quality is not the best."
8,LG 77-inch OLED TV,LG,77,4K,OLED,120,Yes,webOS,"12000,12150","Mega Store,Big Deals",Tel Aviv,Jerusalem,"Wow, what a massive screen. Watching movies feels like a cinematic experience. The black levels are perfect. It’s very heavy. The price is very high. Perfect for a home theater setup. The anti-glare coating works well. The sound is powerful. I love this TV. The perfect TV for me."
9,Hisense 55-inch Roku TV,Hisense,55,4K,LED,60,Yes,Roku OS,"2999,3050","Big Deals,Electro World",Haifa,Tel Aviv,"The Roku OS is simple and fast. It's easy for my parents to use. The picture quality is decent for the price. The sound is not great, but it's okay for news and shows. The build quality feels a bit cheap. It's a great value TV. I'm satisfied with the performance."
10,Samsung 32-inch Full HD TV,Samsung,32,1080p,LED,60,No,Tizen,"1200,1250","Electro World,Tech Pro",Tel Aviv,Jerusalem,"Good little TV for a kids' room or small bedroom. It's not a smart TV, which is disappointing. The sound is surprisingly clear. The picture is fine for casual viewing. It's very light and easy to mount on a wall. It's a basic model, but it's what I needed. The price is reasonable."
