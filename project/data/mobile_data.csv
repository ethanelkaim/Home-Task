The battery life is outstanding, easily lasting a full day. It's a bit heavy and the price is high, but the performance is unmatched. The new Action button is a game-changer. The screen is the best I've ever seen on a phone."
2,Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra,Samsung,6.9,"Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy",12,512,200,5000,"5899,5950,5800","Mega Store,Best TV,Tech Pro",Tel Aviv,Jerusalem,Haifa,"The S Pen is incredibly useful for work and notes. The 100x zoom on the camera is insane, though not always practical. Battery life is solid. It's a big phone, so it's not for everyone. The display is very bright and vibrant."

It goes from 0 to 100 in minutes. The camera is good but not as good as the iPhone or Galaxy. The battery life is excellent. It runs cool even during intense gaming sessions. The design is a bit generic."
5,iPhone 16,Apple,6.1,"Apple A18",8,256,48,3877,"3999,4050","iStore,Mega Store",Tel Aviv,Jerusalem,"A great phone for the price. The camera is solid and the performance is fast for everyday use. The battery life is okay, not great. It's a perfect size for one-handed use. It lacks some of the pro features like the 120Hz refresh rate. It's a reliable phone."

Performance is top-tier. The battery lasts a full day with heavy use. The software can be a bit clunky with pre-installed apps. Very fast charging. A great alternative to the flagship brands."
