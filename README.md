# Zap AI Home Task: AI-Driven E-Commerce Innovation

## Part 1: Overview

This project presents an innovative, AI-powered capability for Zap.co.il, the leading price comparison and e-commerce platform in Israel. The proposed solution, the "AI Buying Advisor," aims to revolutionize the shopping experience by helping users navigate a vast product catalog, overcome information overload, and make confident, data-driven purchasing decisions.

## Part 2: Ideation
As requested, I've proposed three distinct AI-powered features designed to enhance the user experience for those accustomed to AI-style interactions.

1. AI Buying Advisor: A conversational assistant that understands user needs in natural language and recommends products from the catalog. It solves the problem of information overload for complex purchases by providing personalized, on-the-go advice.

2. Smart Review Summarizer: A tool that synthesizes thousands of user reviews into a concise "Key Pros" and "Key Cons" summary. This feature solves the problem of time-consuming manual review analysis, helping users quickly grasp the collective opinion on a product.

3. Visual & Contextual Search: A feature that allows users to search for products by uploading an image. The AI not only identifies the item but also suggests related products, solving the problem of searching for hard-to-describe items and creating opportunities for cross-selling.

## Part 3: Concept Implementation: The "AI Buying Advisor"
I have selected the AI Buying Advisor for the working concept implementation. The prototype demonstrates a multi-domain conversational assistant that can provide recommendations for both televisions and mobile phones based on user input.

### System Architecture
The application is built on a simple yet effective architecture, ideal for a proof-of-concept.

- Frontend (Streamlit): A straightforward chat interface allows users to interact with the AI assistant.

- Backend (LangChain): A Python script acts as the core logic. It uses LangChain to connect the user's conversational input to the AI model and the data source.

- AI Model (Google Gemini): The Gemini 2.0 Flash API is used as the powerful large language model that processes user requests and generates structured, conversational responses.

- Data Layer (CSV Files): Product data for televisions (tv_data.csv) and mobile phones (mobile_data.csv) is stored in local, simulated CSV files.

### Assumptions and Dataset
- Simulated Data: I have created a realistic dataset for two distinct product categories (TVs and mobile phones) to demonstrate the AI's ability to handle multiple product types and extract relevant information for each.

- Product Advisor Persona: The AI is instructed via a detailed prompt to act as an expert "ZapBot," providing friendly, data-driven, and concise recommendations.

- Compatibility Score: I've instructed the AI to generate a Compatibility Score out of 100 based on how well a product matches the user's specific criteria (e.g., budget, features, use case, etc.). This adds a clear, quantifiable metric to aid the user's decision-making.

### Example User Flow & Functionality
The prototype offers a compelling user experience with the following flow:

1. User Inquiry: The user starts the conversation with a request, such as, "I'm looking for a TV for gaming, with a budget of around 6000 shekels."

2. AI Recommendation: The AI, using the provided TV data, recommends the best-matching products, including a Compatibility Score and a summary of pros and cons from simulated reviews.

3. Dynamic Product Categories: The AI can intelligently determine if the user is asking about a "TV" or a "mobile phone" and will use the correct dataset for its recommendation.

4. Interactive Comparison Table: A "Show Full Product Comparison Table" button is available. When clicked, it dynamically displays a detailed table of all products in the category the user last requested (TVs or mobile phones).

## Part 4: Known Limitations and Future Improvements
This prototype is a starting point, and here are its main limitations along with a vision for future improvements:

- Limitation: Static Data. The current system relies on static CSV files, which is not scalable for a real e-commerce platform.

    - Future Improvement: Implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that uses vector embeddings to index and search a live, large-scale product database. This would allow the AI to handle millions of products efficiently and provide real-time information.

- Limitation: Simplified Logic. The "Compatibility Score" is generated by the LLM and lacks a granular, rule-based system for precise feature weighting.

    - Future Improvement: Develop a dedicated AI-powered scoring model that can be fine-tuned to prioritize specific user preferences. For example, if a user mentions "gaming," the model would assign a higher weight to the refresh_rate and processor specifications.

- Limitation: Limited User Interaction. The interface is currently a chat window with a single button.

    - Future Improvement: Add more advanced interactive elements, such as dynamic buttons that appear for each recommended product (e.g., "Compare this product," "Add to Cart"), and integrate a simulated price history chart to visualize price trends for recommended items. This would create a truly modern and engaging shopping experience.


## Getting Started: How to Run the Prototype
This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to get the AI Buying Advisor prototype up and running in a Google Colab environment.

### Step 1: Open the Notebook and Install Dependencies
Open the provided .ipynb file in Google Colab. The first code cell contains all the necessary commands to install the required libraries. Simply run this cell to install streamlit, pandas, langchain, langchain-community, langchain-google-genai, google-generativeai, and pyngrok.

### Step 2: Authenticate Ngrok and Create Data Files
In the subsequent cells, you will find the code to set up your Ngrok authentication token and create the simulated data files (tv_data.csv and mobile_data.csv). Ensure you replace "YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE" with your actual token from the Ngrok dashboard. This step also programmatically creates the app.py file from the content of the notebook.

### Step 3: Launch the Streamlit App
After running the setup cells, you will find a dedicated code cell to launch the Streamlit application. This cell uses subprocess to run the app.py file in the background and then connects to it via a public Ngrok tunnel.

### Step 4: Interact with the Prototype
Once the cell has finished executing, a public URL will be printed in the output. Click this link to open the Streamlit application in your browser. You can now chat with the ZapBot AI Advisor and test its functionality, including its ability to provide product recommendations and display the dynamic comparison table.
